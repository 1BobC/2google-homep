Finding better code.
The code in these files is from the first TOP project
google-home-page and it was posted to TOP project 
public page by Zachingle. The code looked very clear
and more comprehensive than my own code and it includes
seperate resetCSS and styleCSS.
so I copied it. It didn't work quite the same from my
files but I will refer back to it and try modifications
to help me learn HTTPS and CSS. I already see the value
of reset CSS.
